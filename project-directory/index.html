            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>As you can probably tell from the page title, my name is Nathan Cashman. As an eventual jobseeker, I would like to give potential employers the oportunity to learn about me. I currently reside in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Prior to my becoming a developer, I graduated from Drake University with a Bachelor's degree in Music Education. Although I have left the field of education, I still play trombone whenever I get the chance. In my free time, I like to play video games, watch anime, and spend time with friends and family. </p>
